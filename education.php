		<div class="p-lg-5 edumain_bg mb-lg-5 mb-4">
			<h4 class="font-weight-medium mb-4">What are lab-grown diamonds ?</h4>
			<p>Lab-grown diamonds or cultured diamonds are the stones grown in highly controlled laboratory conditions using groundbreaking technological processes that emulate the Earth’s natural developing process where diamonds form in the mantle of the Earth. The resulting diamonds are physically and chemically identical to mined diamonds as they are made of the same material: pure carbon, crystallized in isotropic 3D form.</p>
			<p>Lab-Grown Diamonds is not limited to its ideal color i.e. colorless but it also ranges from color D to Z Just like natural diamond.</p>
			<p>Scientists have been experimenting with Lab-Grown Diamonds for centuries, but recent technological advancements have helped us perfect the resulting diamonds and these are just like the earth-mined ones but seem to be better as they are made most fairly and ethically.</p>
			<p class="mb-0">With <strong class="px-1">SAYARTH</strong>, Lab Grown Diamonds come with a superior quality and with its best value.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="p-lg-5 edumain_bg mb-lg-5 mb-4">
			<h4 class="font-weight-medium mb-4">How are lab diamonds made ?</h4>
			<p>Our lab-created diamonds are grown from tiny carbon seeds of pre-existing diamonds. Advanced technology – either extreme pressure and heat or a special deposition process known as CVD – mimics the natural method of diamond formation. Some lab diamonds grown through deposition may also undergo pressure and heat treatment process is known as HPHT.</p>
			<p>A CVD diamond starts as a thin slice of the diamond seed, which is placed in a highly heated chamber, and filled with carbon-rich gases. Through the magic of technology, carbon, bonds with the diamond seed, and it crystallizes.</p>
			<p>HPHT diamond starts as a small diamond seed that is placed into carbon and exposed to extreme temperatures and high pressure — conditions similar to those beneath the earth’s surface.</p>
			<p class="mb-0">Lab-grown diamonds can be grown in 6-12 weeks.</p>

		<div class="p-lg-5 edumain_bg mb-lg-5 mb-4">
			<h4 class="font-weight-medium mb-4">How is lab-grown different from mine ?</h4>
			<p class="font-weight-bold">The first question we always get is <i>"Are lab-created diamonds real diamonds ?”</i></p>
			<p>The answer is very simple <b><i>“YES”</i></b>.</p>
			<p>The main difference between lab-grown diamonds and natural diamonds is their origin-- Mined or Natural Diamonds are formed beneath the earth’s surface, while Lab Grown Diamonds are grown above ground in a highly regulated environment.</p>
			<p>Another difference is that Lab Grown Diamonds can be up to 20% - 40% less expensive than natural diamonds. This competitive pricing makes them appealing to couples.</p>
			<p>While some may want to debate on which type of diamond is “better” in reality, mined diamonds and lab-created diamonds aren’t in competition with one another. We believe that Diamonds always represent love, which can never be compared.</p>
			<p>The true significance of the diamond you choose is not based on its origin, grading, size, or value.</p>
			<p class="font-weight-bold"><i>“The significance of the diamonds you choose is the love it represents.”</i></p>
			<p class="mb-0">Our lab-grown diamonds display the same physical, chemical, and optical characteristics as natural diamonds and exhibit the same fire, scintillation and sparkle.</p>

						<p>The term “diamond cut” refers to the quality of a diamond’s proportions and symmetry. These elements determine how much light a diamond captures and reflects and therefore how much it sparkles.</p>
						<p>There are four grades of diamond cut : Ideal, Very Good, Good, and Poor.</p>
						<p>If you compare two diamonds of different cut grades, you will see that the higher cut grade has significantly more sparkle. There will also be a difference in their prices, the one with the better cut grade commands a higher price. Of the 4 Cs, cut is generally recognized as the most important, since it has the greatest impact on a diamond’s appearance and quality.</p>

						<p>Clarity refers to the quality of a diamond as it relates to the existence, location, and type of inclusions or “birthmarks” that the diamond has. Internal characteristics are known as Inclusions and they can be seen as small imperfections in the stone. Diamonds with higher clarity grades are more valued, with “Internally Flawless – IF” topping the list. VVS1- VS2 diamonds are eye clean diamonds, meaning no inclusions will be visible to the naked eye. While SI1 and SI2 stones are technically eye clean, but some can detect the imperfections depending upon the type and location of the inclusions without magnification. And included diamonds (I1, I2) have inclusions that will be visible through naked eye without magnification.</p>

					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-color" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-color-tab">
						<p>The color actually refers to the lack of color in a diamond.  D, E, and F are colorless diamonds that present as the whitest stones, D being the highest color grade available. G, H, I, and J are considered near colorless diamonds and will have warmer tones.</p>
						<div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4">
							<img src="assets/images/diamonds/color.jpg" alt="color" class="w-45">
						</div>
						<p class="mb-0">While diamonds in the “colorless” category reflect the purest white light, it is hard for most consumers to see any color in the “near colorless” category. That’s why a “near colorless” diamond is a safe bet if you plan to set it in yellow or rose gold jewellery, since the warm color of the metal makes any yellowness in the diamond less noticeable. But if you want the purest white diamond, select one that’s “colorless” and set it in white gold or platinum.</p>

					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-carat" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-carat-tab">
						<p>The weight of a Carat diamond reflects the actual weight of a diamond, while the dimensions of a diamond reflect the measurements and how the weight is distributed. That being said, you can have a diamond with a lower carat weight that offers larger measurements than a diamond of a higher carat weight.</p>
						<p>At <b class="px-1">SAYARTH</b>, we recommend seeking a balance between cut and carat weight in order to ensure a symmetrical, brilliantly sparkling diamond.</p>
						<p class="mb-0">Many things will be taken into account while deciding where you want your diamond to fall in the grading scale. The first question to ask yourself is, what is most important to you — is the size of the stone that most impresses you, or is it the color? Or is the most important thing about the diamond’s sparkle and fire? How important is clarity to you? Is “eye-clean” your desire? Based on your Wish list, we can determine what is non-negotiable regarding the attributes of your diamond, consider your budget, and take it from there!</p>

			<h4 class="font-weight-medium mb-5">FAQ's</h4>

			<h5 class="mb-3">1. Is a lab-created diamond better than an earth-grown diamond ?</h5>
			<p class="mb-5">This will really depend on your taste and preferences. Both can be conflict-free and will range widely in terms of grading and the 4 C’s. Lab-grown gems do allow you to get the most out of your budget, giving up to 30% more size for the same cost. Mined diamonds are naturally occurring, rarer by definition, and often seen as more traditional.</p>

			<h5 class="mb-3">2. Where do lab-created diamonds actually come from ?</h5>
			<p class="mb-5">Using modern, highly advanced technology, these diamonds are “grown” from a tiny sliver into a full diamond.</p>

			<h5 class="mb-3">3. Are they any different from earth-grown diamonds ?</h5>
			<p class="mb-5">Surprisingly to many people, they are identical in both chemical and optical composition. More importantly for some, the sparkle factor is also the same. The only difference is where they come from.</p>

			<h5 class="mb-3">4. Can I still get an appraisal and lab certificate ?</h5>
			<p class="mb-0">Absolutely. All diamonds can come with an appraisal and certificate, regardless of their origin.</p>
